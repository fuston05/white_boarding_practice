# Given the following array of values, print out all the elements in reverse order, with each element on a new line.
# For example, given the list
arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

# reverse arr
# arr.reverse()

# for loop over arr
for i in range(1, len(arr)+1):
    print(arr[-i])
# print each


# Your output should be
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.
# Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code. Run through the UPER problem solving framework while going through your thought process.
